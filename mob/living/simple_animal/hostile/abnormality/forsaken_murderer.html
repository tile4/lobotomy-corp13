I placed the 50% chance here because i want it to be sort of unpredictable.</p>
<p>Roll is a proc from the offical Dream Maker Guide.
1 is the amount of dice and 6 is the sides of those dice.
I tried to put the link to the guide here but the codebase got upset so just try to find it at the byond website.</p>
<p>Playsound is a unique proc that... plays a sound at the defined location.
The first slot is location.
Second spot is the sound that is played.
Third is the volume of the sound.
Four is if it has a random pitch.
Five is sound range.
So i guess something can be quiet but heard normally if its sound range is high?</p>
<p>This happens when the abnormality breaches.
If your abnormality doesnt Breach then the proc you want is ZeroQliphoth.
Other abnormality procs can be found in the _abnormality.dm file.</p><h3 id="proc/examine"><aside class="parent"><a title="/atom" href="atom.html#proc/examine">&uarr;</a></aside>examine<aside>(/<a href="mob.html">mob</a>/user)

Just so you know most things without SECONDS or MINUTES after it are in deciseconds</p>
<p>This made forsaken murderer waddle.
Im supprised it was this easy to do this.
Elements and Components are special non object code that you can attach to things.
Element Variables are shared amongst all instances of it but component are individualand able to be altered without changing all the other instances of it.</p>
<p>1 is distance thrown.
False is if it can throw anchored objects.
True if doesnt apply damage or stun when hits a wall.</p>
<p>This proc updates the icon state and is part of update_icon().
If your abnormality has multiple visual forms then you can define them here.</p></main>
